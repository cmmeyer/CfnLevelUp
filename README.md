# AWS CloudFormation Level-Up

This presentation is written in markdown using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) and [backslide](https://github.com/sinedied/backslide).

Slides are in the `presentation.md`. Style sheets are in `templates/`. All graphic assets are stored in the `assets/` directory.

You'll need backslide installed to build new PDF versions: (`npm install -g backslide`), then run `build.sh`.

To present the slides directly from the markdown, run `bs serve` from this directory.
